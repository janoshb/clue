NAME
  ahm -- acyclic complexity measure

SYNOPSIS
  ahm [-h] [-a] [-c] [-q] [-t]

DESCRIPTION
  Static analysis code complexity measure for C style code (C, C++, C#, javascript, java).
  Measures standard input stream (stdin) to provide an absolute integer value. Helps tracing 
  condition paths.

  The following options are available:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -a          acyclic complexity, (linear-quadratic measure), regards nested
              code structures (default)
  -c          cyclomatic complexity, (linear measure), condition count
  -q          unique condition paths, (linear-quadratic measure)
  -t          trace unique condition paths
